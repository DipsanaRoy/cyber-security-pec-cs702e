## ⚠️ Caution  

Heads up! MAKAUT loves “troll questions” — they might throw in topics like cryptocurrency, trivia, or random GK. Don’t panic; just stay alert!

## ✅ Study Workflow

1. Read this `README` for the **concept skeleton and mnemonics**.
2. Dive into `NOTES.md` for full explanations and examples.
3. Review PYQs (`previous-year-questions.md`) to conquer exam tendencies.
4. If time permits go through `MAKAUT Organizer` (**If you don't like organizers, no need to study organizers** - it'll confuse you more & waste your time)
