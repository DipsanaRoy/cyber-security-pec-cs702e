## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution

I have noticed MAKAUT asking trolled questions in this examination mostly from Cryptocurrency rather than Cyber Security itself.

## üìå My Advice

I suggest if you are studying this with at least 1 week time prior your exams you can do the following:

1. Go through this README, it completely follows the syllabus and will help you grasp the concepts with ease
2. Study the MAKAUT Organizer (Look for MAKAUT Organizer in the Google Drive)
3. Go through the solved PYQs (Previous Year Questions) by the name PYQs.md in this repository
