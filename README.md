## üîë Key Cyber Security Terms

Let's go through an overview first then we'll expand them unit wise. Trust me it'll help you remember everything.

### 1. DoS & DDoS

* **DoS (Denial of Service):** Attacker floods a server with too many requests, making it unavailable.
  *Analogy:* One person keeps calling your phone nonstop so no one else can reach you.
* **DDoS (Distributed DoS):** Same, but thousands of computers (botnets) attack at once.
  *Analogy:* Imagine thousands of spam callers hitting your number simultaneously.

---

### 2. Incoming & Outgoing Network Traffic

* **Incoming:** Data packets coming into your system (downloads, requests from others).
* **Outgoing:** Data leaving your system (uploads, sending emails, API calls).
  üëâ Monitoring both helps detect abnormal activity (like hidden malware sending data out).

---

### 3. Spyware

* Malicious software that secretly collects your info (keystrokes, browsing, credentials).
  *Example:* A fake free game secretly logging your credit card inputs.

---

### 4. Botnets

* Networks of compromised computers (zombies) controlled by a hacker.
* Used for DDoS, spamming, crypto mining.
  *Example:* Mirai botnet took down Netflix & Twitter in 2016.

---

### 5. Zero-Day Exploits

* Attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities before the vendor even knows about them.
  üëâ *‚ÄúDay zero‚Äù = no patch exists yet.*
  *Exam line:* They are the most dangerous because no defense is ready.

---

### 6. Penetration Testing

* Ethical hacking technique to simulate attacks and find weaknesses before real hackers do.
* Steps: Planning ‚Üí Scanning ‚Üí Exploiting ‚Üí Reporting.

---

### 7. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

* Attacker secretly intercepts communication between two parties.
  *Example:* On public Wi-Fi, hacker intercepts your banking login before sending it to the bank.

---

### 8. Backup & Recovery

* Process of saving copies of data and restoring after loss/cyberattack.
* Types: Full, Incremental, Differential.
  üëâ *Key for ransomware defense.*

---

### 9. Espionage

* Unauthorized spying to steal confidential info (corporate/government).

---

üí° **How to think for exams:**
Most of these terms are *definitional* and *example-based*. Professors love asking:

* **Differentiate malware types (virus vs worm vs Trojan).**
* **Explain DoS vs DDoS.**
* **What is a zero-day exploit? Why dangerous?**
* **What are social engineering attacks with examples?**

---

## üîπ Introduction to Cyber Security

* **Definition:** Cyber security = protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats.
* **Goal:** Ensure **CIA triad** ‚Äì Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.

  * **Confidentiality:** Only authorized access to data. (Passwords, encryption)
  * **Integrity:** Data must not be tampered with. (Hashing, checksums)
  * **Availability:** Systems must be up & running for authorized users. (Backups, redundancy)
* **Why Important?**

  * Our dependency on internet + digital systems ‚Üí higher risk.
  * Attacks can lead to financial loss, data theft, reputation damage, even national security issues.
    *Exam Angle:* Often asked: ‚ÄúWhat is Cyber Security? State the objectives.‚Äù

## üîπ Types of Cyber Threats

### 1. Malware

* General term for malicious software (virus, worms, Trojans, spyware, ransomware).
* Purpose: steal, disrupt, damage.

### 2. Phishing

* Fake emails/websites tricking users to reveal sensitive info (passwords, credit card).
* *Ex:* A fake bank login page.

### 3. Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)

* Overloading a system with traffic ‚Üí crashes or becomes unavailable.

### üíî 10. Dating Scam (Romance Scam / Catfishing)

**What it is:**
A type of social engineering and online fraud where a criminal creates a fake identity on a dating app or social media to form a romantic relationship with the victim. The goal is to gain their trust and eventually, their money.

**How it works (The Playbook):**

1. **The Bait:** The scammer creates an attractive fake profile (this is "catfishing").
2. **The Hook:** They contact the victim, shower them with love and attention, and quickly profess strong feelings.
3. **The Story:** Once trust is built, they create a crisis. Common stories include:
    * "I need money for a plane ticket to come see you."
    * "I have a medical emergency and can't afford the surgery."
    * "My business is failing, and I need a loan to save it."
4. **The Payoff:** They convince the victim to send money, often via wire transfers, gift cards, or even cryptocurrency, which are hard to trace and reverse.

**Why it's effective:** It preys on emotional vulnerability and the human desire for connection. The victim often doesn't realize they've been scammed until it's too late.

---

### üì¶ 11. OTP Scam (Delivery Scam)

**What it is:**
A very common and modern form of phishing where scammers impersonate delivery agents from companies like Amazon, Flipkart, or FedEx to steal your One-Time Password (OTP) and commit fraud.

**How it works (Step-by-Step):**

1. **The Trigger:** You place an online order. Scammers sometimes get basic info like your name, product, and phone number from data leaks or insecure channels.
2. **The Call/SMS:** You receive a call or SMS from a number that seems to be from the delivery company. They confirm your order details to sound legitimate.
3. **The Excuse:** They give a convincing reason why they need your OTP. For example:
    * "We need to verify your address before delivery."
    * "The OTP is to confirm the delivery time slot."
    * "We need it to process a refund for you."
4. **The Theft:** The moment you read out the OTP, the scammer uses it to:
    * **Confirm a fraudulent transaction** they initiated on your card.
    * **Gain access to your bank/wallet account** that uses OTP-based authentication.
    * **Activate a SIM swap** to take control of your phone number.

**The Golden Rule:** **NEVER, EVER share an OTP with anyone.** A legitimate delivery agent or bank executive will **NEVER** ask for it. The OTP is the final key to your castle; sharing it is like handing a thief your keys.

üëâ *Exam Tip:* Professors love ‚Äúlist and explain types of cyber threats with examples.‚Äù

## üîë Encryption & Decryption

* **Encryption:** Converting readable data (*plaintext*) into unreadable format (*ciphertext*) using an algorithm + key.
* **Decryption:** Converting ciphertext back into plaintext using the key.

### Types

1. **Symmetric Encryption** (one key for both encryption & decryption)

   * Fast but key distribution is hard.
   * Example: AES, DES.

2. **Asymmetric Encryption** (two keys: public + private)

   * Public key encrypts, private key decrypts.
   * Example: RSA, ECC.
   * Used in digital signatures, SSL/TLS.

üëâ **Golden Line for Exams:** Encryption ensures confidentiality, while hashing ensures integrity.

## üîë Quick Concepts

### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

* Symmetric encryption algorithm (same key for encrypt/decrypt).
* Very secure, used in Wi-Fi security, file encryption, banking.
* Successor to DES.

### DES (Data Encryption Standard)

* Old symmetric algorithm (56-bit key).
* Now considered insecure (can be brute-forced).
* Replaced by AES.

### RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)

* Asymmetric encryption algorithm (public/private key).
* Used for secure key exchange, digital signatures.
* *Ex:* When you log in to your bank, RSA is behind the curtain.

### ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)

* Another asymmetric encryption like RSA but uses elliptic curves ‚Üí smaller keys with same security.
* Popular in mobile & IoT because it‚Äôs lightweight.

### SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security)

* Protocols that secure communication over the internet.
* Provide encryption + authentication.
* *Example:* When you see üîí HTTPS in your browser ‚Üí TLS is working.

üëâ Easy way to connect:

* **AES/DES** = Symmetric.
* **RSA/ECC** = Asymmetric.
* **SSL/TLS** = Protocols using these algorithms to secure communication.

### Mnemonic

SSL DARE TLS: Secure Socket Layer, DES, AES, RSA, ECC, Transport Layer Security.

üí° *Write these five times in a notebook:*
Data Encryption Standard,
Advanced Encryption Standard,
Rivest-Shamir-Aldeman,

## üîë IDS & IPS

* **IDS (Intrusion Detection System):**

  * *Monitors* network traffic for suspicious activity.
  * Passive ‚Üí alerts admins but doesn‚Äôt block.
  * Analogy: CCTV camera.

* **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):**

  * *Monitors & actively blocks* malicious traffic.
  * Inline, real-time prevention.
  * Analogy: Security guard who not only spots the thief but stops him.

üëâ IDS = Detect ‚Üí Alert.
üëâ IPS = Detect ‚Üí Block.

---

## üîπ Cyber Security Tools and Techniques

These are the shields and swords we use:

1. **Firewalls**

   * Block/allow traffic based on rules.
   * *Think*: Gatekeeper of your network.

2. **Antivirus/Anti-malware**

   * Detect and remove viruses, worms, Trojans.

3. **IDS/IPS** (already covered)

   * IDS = Detect, IPS = Detect + Block.

4. **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**

   * Encrypts internet traffic, hides IP.
   * Makes communication secure even on public Wi-Fi.

5. **Encryption Tools**

   * Protect data in storage and transit (AES, RSA, etc.).

6. **Penetration Testing Tools**

   * Simulate attacks to find weak points.
   * Ex: Metasploit, Burp Suite.

7. **Backup & Recovery Systems**

   * Protect against data loss and ransomware.

8. **Authentication Mechanisms**

   * Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), biometrics.

üëâ **Exam Note:** Tools fall into categories ‚Üí *Prevention, Detection, Recovery.*

## üîë Encryption vs Hashing

### Encryption

* **Purpose:** Protect confidentiality (keep data secret).
* **Process:** Plaintext ‚Üí Ciphertext using an algorithm + key.
* **Reversible:** Yes (you can decrypt back to original with the key).
* **Example:**

  * Message ‚ÄúI love CyberSec‚Äù ‚Üí Encrypted (nonsense-looking text).
  * Only the person with the right key can read it.

---

### Hashing

* **Purpose:** Protect integrity (ensure data hasn‚Äôt been tampered with).
* **Process:** Input ‚Üí Fixed-length hash value using a hash function.
* **Irreversible:** No way to get the original message back from the hash.
* **Example:**

  * File download site gives you file + SHA256 hash.
  * After downloading, you hash the file. If values match ‚Üí file is original, not altered.

---

### ‚ú® Key Difference Line (Exam Gold)

* **Encryption ensures confidentiality** ‚Üí No one else can read your secret data.
* **Hashing ensures integrity** ‚Üí No one can tamper with your data without detection.

üëâ Bonus: Sometimes they‚Äôre combined. Example: SSL/TLS uses both ‚Äî encryption to keep messages secret, hashing to make sure messages aren‚Äôt altered in transit.

---

So basically:

* üîí Encryption = ‚ÄúKeep it secret.‚Äù
* üõ°Ô∏è Hashing = ‚ÄúKeep it safe from tampering.‚Äù

Alright üöÄ mini pop-quiz time! Don‚Äôt overthink, just go with instinct ‚Äî short answers are fine:

---

## üîπ Quiz: Encryption vs Hashing

1. **If you want to make sure no one can read your message while it‚Äôs being sent, what do you use?**

2. **If you want to make sure a file downloaded from the internet hasn‚Äôt been altered by an attacker, what do you use?**

3. **Can you get the original data back from encryption? From hashing?**

4. **Fill in the blanks:**

   * Encryption ensures \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
   * Hashing ensures \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

### Answers

‚úîÔ∏è **Q1:** Encryption ‚Äî correct.
‚úîÔ∏è **Q2:** Hashing ‚Äî correct.
‚úîÔ∏è **Q3:** Yes, encryption is reversible with a key. Hashing = one-way, permanent.

---

### üîë Key Point: Intent Matters

The same attack can be classified differently based on who does it and why:

**Example: A DDoS attack...**

* ...launched by a `script kiddie` to show off to friends is **cybercrime** (vandalism).
* ...launched by a `hacktivist` group to protest a policy is **hacktivism** (digital activism).
* ...launched by a `state-sponsored group` to shut down a country's banks is **cyber warfare**.
* ...launched by an `extremist group` to cripple a city's power grid and demand political concessions is **cyber terrorism**.

---

### ‚úÖ In a Nutshell

* Cyber terrorism = using hacking to **terrorize, coerce, pressure, or destabilize** a society or government. It‚Äôs not about money‚Äîit‚Äôs about power, fear, and ideology.

* It's the convergence(main cause) of **cyberspace** and **political violence.**

---

### 11. Cyber Security of Critical Infrastructure

Critical Infrastructure (CI) = systems essential for national security & daily life.

* **Sectors**: Power grids, oil & gas, hospitals, transport, water supply, telecom, finance.
* **Why vulnerable?**

  * Old legacy systems (SCADA/ICS not designed with security).
  * Interconnected ‚Üí one weak link = chain collapse.
  * High impact ‚Üí even short downtime = chaos.
* **Defense strategies**:

  * Segmentation (air-gapped networks).
  * Continuous monitoring.
  * Redundancy & failover systems.
  * Legal protection ‚Üí In India: *National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC)*.

---

### 12. Cybersecurity ‚Äî Organizational Implications

For organizations, cybersecurity is not just tech ‚Üí it‚Äôs **business survival**.

* **Business losses**:

  * Financial (data breach costs, downtime).
  * Reputation (loss of customer trust).
* **Legal liabilities**:

  * **GDPR (EU)** ‚Üí heavy fines for data misuse.
  * **IT Act 2000 (India)** ‚Üí penalties for breaches.
* **Governance Frameworks**:

  * ISO 27001 (InfoSec Mgmt).
  * NIST CSF (Identify ‚Üí Protect ‚Üí Detect ‚Üí Respond ‚Üí Recover).
  * COBIT (IT governance).
* **Security Investment**:

  * **SOCs** (Security Operations Centers) ‚Üí 24x7 monitoring.
  * Threat intelligence & red team exercises.
  * Employee training (since *humans = weakest link*).

üí° Bottom line: Cybersecurity is **not optional**, it‚Äôs a boardroom-level priority.

## üìò Unit 2 ‚Äî Hackers and Cyber Crimes

### 1. Types of Hackers

When people hear ‚Äúhacker,‚Äù they usually imagine a person in a hoodie breaking into banks ü§£. But in reality, **hackers aren‚Äôt always bad**. They‚Äôre just people with technical skills who use them differently.

* **White Hat Hackers (Ethical Hackers):**

  * Work with permission.
  * Example: Companies hire them for penetration testing (to find flaws before criminals do).
  * They follow a scope and rules of engagement.

* **Black Hat Hackers (Criminals):**

  * Break into systems without consent.
  * Motives: money, fame, revenge, spying.
  * Example: Ransomware gangs like ‚ÄúConti‚Äù or ‚ÄúREvil.‚Äù

* **Grey Hat Hackers:**

  * Somewhere in between.
  * They may break into a system **without permission**, but not always for evil. Sometimes they disclose flaws (responsibly or irresponsibly).
  * Example: A researcher hacks into a site, then emails the company, ‚ÄúFix this or I‚Äôll leak it.‚Äù

* **Script Kiddies:**

  * Beginners who don‚Äôt really understand hacking.
  * They use pre-built tools/scripts found online (like Kali Linux payloads) without knowing how they work.
  * More of a nuisance than a real threat, but can still cause harm.

* **Hacktivists:**

  * Hacking for activism.
  * Goal: spread ideology, embarrass organizations, protest.
  * Example: Anonymous group defacing websites for political causes.

* **State-Sponsored Hackers (Nation-State Hackers):**

  * Backed by governments.
  * Used for espionage, stealing secrets, disrupting enemy infrastructure.
  * Example: Alleged Russian groups (APT28, Fancy Bear), Chinese APTs, US NSA‚Äôs cyber operations.

### üë©‚Äçüè´ Types of Hackers ‚Äî Comparative Table

| Hacker Type          | Hat Color üé© | Intent / Goal                        | Example                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **White Hat**        | ü§ç White     | Legal, ethical, improve security     | Company hires them for penetration testing            |
| **Black Hat**        | üè¥ Black     | Illegal, malicious, steal data/money | Hacker stealing credit card info                      |
| **Grey Hat**         | ‚ö™ Grey      | Illegal methods but no bad intent    | Finds bug in govt website, reports without permission |
| **Script Kiddies**   | üë∂ No hat    | No deep skills, just use tools       | Teen using ready-made malware from forums             |
| **Hacktivists**      | ‚úä Variable  | Political/social agenda              | Anonymous defacing gov websites                       |
| **State-sponsored**  | üïµÔ∏è Any hat   | Government spying/attacks            | China/USA hacking rival nations                       |
| **Cyber Terrorists** | üí£ None      | Spread fear, chaos                   | Attacking power grids or hospitals                    |

#### üí° Tip to remember

Think of hackers like characters in a movie:

* White Hat = Hero,
* Black Hat = Villain,
* Grey Hat = Anti-hero,
* Script Kiddie = Side character messing things up,
* Hacktivist = Rebel,
* State-Sponsored = Government‚Äôs secret agents.

---

### 2. Hackers vs Crackers

This one‚Äôs a common confusion. Many people call all bad hackers "crackers," but the line is a bit blurry. Let‚Äôs clear it:

#### Hackers (Original Meaning)

* Not negative at first!
* Originally (1960s‚Äì70s at MIT), ‚Äúhacker‚Äù meant **a tech enthusiast** who loved tinkering, coding, solving problems.
* Today it‚Äôs broader ‚Üí could be good (ethical hacker) or bad (malicious hacker).

#### Crackers

* Term for those who **illegally break into systems** or **break software protections.**
* Example: Someone who ‚Äúcracks‚Äù paid software to remove license checks.
* Purely negative connotation, unlike the word ‚Äúhacker‚Äù which can be good or bad.

#### Did Crackers bless us (‚Äútorrent messiahs‚Äù)?

Crackers made the following possible too:

* Once upon a time, there exists a lot of movie watchers who survived the harsh prices by using torrent and VLC Media Player üòÇ.
* When you use a paid software for free via cracked torrent sites you're providing the price indirectly by selling your privacy üò≠.

---

‚öñÔ∏è **Simple distinction:**

* **Hacker = skillful person** (good or bad, depends on intent).
* **Cracker = bad guy** (always malicious, especially breaking protections).

---

üéØ **Memory Trick:**
Think of ‚ÄúCracker‚Äù like cracking a lock. If someone cracks your lock, they‚Äôre clearly not doing it for fun, they‚Äôre stealing something.

---

### 3. Cyber-Attacks and Vulnerabilities

üîë **Core Idea:**
A cyber-attack exploits a **vulnerability** (weakness) in a system, app, or human.

* **Cyber-Attack** = malicious action (like phishing, DoS, malware injection).
* **Vulnerability** = weakness/flaw (like unpatched software, weak passwords, misconfigurations).

---

Cyber-attacks exploit weaknesses (vulnerabilities) in systems, apps, or human behavior.

* **Attack** = deliberate action (phishing, ransomware, DoS).
* **Vulnerability** = weakness (unpatched software, weak password, misconfigurations).
* **Exploit** = the actual tool/technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability.

üëâ Example:

* Weak Wi-Fi password (**vulnerability**) ‚Üí attacker uses brute force (**exploit**) ‚Üí steals your Wi-Fi bandwidth (**attack**).

---

#### üß© Examples of Vulnerabilities

* Unpatched OS/software (e.g., Windows not updated).
* Misconfigured firewalls.
* Using ‚Äúadmin/admin123‚Äù as a password (üò¨).
* Outdated SSL certificates.
* Employees clicking malicious links.

---

#### üïµÔ∏è Attack + Vulnerability Example

* **Attack:** SQL Injection.
* **Vulnerability:** Poorly coded login form that doesn‚Äôt sanitize input.

‚ö° **Link it like this:**
Vulnerability = unlocked door üö™
Cyber-Attack = thief walking in üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### üîê SSL Certificates (now mostly TLS)

SSL = **Secure Sockets Layer** (old term, but everyone still says ‚ÄúSSL‚Äù). TLS = **Transport Layer Security** (modern standard).

Basically, an **SSL/TLS certificate** is a **digital passport** for a website üåç. It proves the site is who it says it is, and it enables **encrypted communication** between your browser and the server.

---

### üß© What it does

1. **Authentication** ‚Äì Confirms the website is legit (not a fake phishing site).
2. **Encryption** ‚Äì Data you send/receive (passwords, card numbers) is scrambled üîí.
3. **Trust** ‚Äì Shows up as the üîí padlock in your browser‚Äôs address bar.

---

### üåü Example

* You log into your bank site.
* Without SSL: Your username/password could be sniffed as plain text üò±.
* With SSL: Data is encrypted into unreadable gibberish ‚ú®, only the bank‚Äôs server can decrypt it.

---

‚ö†Ô∏è If a site‚Äôs SSL is expired or missing, you‚Äôll see **‚ÄúNot Secure‚Äù** in the browser. That‚Äôs a vulnerability ‚Äî attackers can exploit it (man-in-the-middle attacks, fake sites, etc.).

üòÅ ‚Äî The **‚Äús‚Äù in HTTPS** literally stands for **secure**, and that security is powered by SSL/TLS certificates.

---

### 4. Malware Threats

Malware = **malicious software**.

1. ### **Adware**

   * Hooks into browsers (extensions, registry run-keys, scheduled tasks).
   * Opens pop-ups, redirects search results, shows fake ads.
   * Often bundled with pirated software.

   #### üì¢ Types of Adware

   Adware's main goal is to **generate revenue by showing ads**. Its "type" is defined by its level of intrusiveness and how it gets on your system.

   a. **Legitimate Adware (The Annoying but Legal Kind)**
      * **How it works:** This is often bundled with free software. You agree to install it in exchange for using the software for free. The ads are displayed within the program itself.
      * **Example:** Many free PDF converters or video players show ads inside their application window.

   b. **Spyware-Based Adware (The Illegal, Malicious Kind)**
      * **How it works:** This is installed without your consent, often through software bundles ("potentially unwanted programs" or PUPs) or exploits. It's more malicious because it **tracks your browsing habits** to serve you targeted ads.
      * **It can also:**
         * Redirect your browser searches.
         * Change your homepage to an ad-filled search engine.
         * Install browser toolbars that collect data.
      * **Example:** The **Fireball** adware infected millions of computers, taking over browsers to generate fake ad revenue.

   c. **Scareware**
      * **How it works:** This is a nasty type of adware that uses **fear and deception**. It bombards you with pop-up ads pretending to be system alerts, warning you of a (non-existent) virus. The goal is to trick you into buying fake antivirus software.
      * **Example:** "WARNING! YOUR COMPUTER IS INFECTED WITH 127 VIRUSES! CLICK HERE TO CLEAN IT NOW!" These pop-ups look official but are complete scams.

2. **Spyware/Keylogger**

   * Runs silently.
   * Keyloggers (record keystrokes), clipboard stealers, screen recorders.
   * Common in cracked apps and ‚Äúfree toolbars.‚Äù

3. **Ransomware**

   * Encrypts files with strong ciphers (AES, RSA).
   * Drops a ransom note (`readme.txt`, like your teacher saw).
   * Without the decryption key (held by attacker), files are locked forever.

4. **Rootkits**

   * Hide themselves deep inside OS (drivers, kernel modules).
   * Make malicious processes/files invisible to user and antivirus.

5. **Worms**

   * Spread *on their own* through networks (e.g., email, USB, unpatched servers).
   * Famous: WannaCry (2017).

6. **Trojans**

   * Fake software carrying hidden payload (backdoor, spyware, crypto-miner).
   * Example: ‚ÄúFree Game.exe‚Äù that secretly gives hacker remote access.

7. **Backdoors**

   * Secret entry points intentionally created (or planted by malware).
   * Allow attackers to bypass authentication later.

---

üí° **Why cracked/torrent software is risky?**
Because attackers know: ‚ÄúPeople want it free ‚Üí They‚Äôll disable antivirus to install ‚Üí Perfect chance to slip in malware.‚Äù
Exactly what happened to your teacher üòÖ

üëâ **Real case:** WannaCry ransomware in 2017 hit hospitals, banks, railways.

---

### 5. Sniffing

In the simplest terms, **sniffing is the act of intercepting, capturing, and monitoring data packets as they travel across a network.** Think of it like tapping a phone line to listen to a conversation.

A specialized software tool called a **sniffer** (or more formally, a **packet analyzer**) is used to do this. It puts a device's network card into "promiscuous mode," allowing it to see all the data flowing through the network, not just the data intended for it.

---

#### The Car Analogy

Imagine a network is a highway, and data packets are cars carrying letters (your data).

* **Normal Operation:** Your house (computer) only accepts cars (data packets) that have your specific address on them.
* **Sniffing:** Someone sets up a camera on the highway that records every single car that passes by, reads all the letters inside, and notes where they're going and coming from. This camera is the **sniffer**.

---

#### Why is Sniffing Done? The Two Sides

Sniffing itself is a neutral tool. Its morality depends on **who is doing it** and **why**.

#### 1. The Good Side: Ethical & Administrative

Network administrators use sniffing for crucial maintenance and security tasks. This is **perfectly legal** with authorization.

* **Troubleshooting:** To find and fix network problems, like why a website is loading slowly.
* **Monitoring Performance:** To analyze network traffic and see if the network is getting overloaded.
* **Security Monitoring:** To detect malicious activity, like intrusion attempts or malware calling home.

#### 2. The Bad Side: Malicious & Unethical

This is what most people fear when they hear "sniffing." Hackers use it to steal sensitive information illegally.

* **Stealing Credentials:** Capturing usernames and passwords sent over unencrypted connections (like on some public Wi-Fi networks).
* **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate a user and gain unauthorized access to their accounts (like social media or email).
* **Espionage:** Reading confidential company emails or documents being sent over the network.
* **Mapping the Network:** Understanding the structure of a network to plan further attacks.

---

#### Types of Sniffing

| Type | How It Works | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Passive Sniffing** | Listening to traffic on a network hub, where all data is broadcast to every device. Easy and undetectable. | Listening to a conversation in a crowded, noisy room where everyone is shouting. |
| **Active Sniffing** | Used on switched networks. Tricks the network switch into sending the sniffer traffic meant for other devices. More complex and detectable. | Tricking the post office into sending you everyone's mail instead of just your own. |

---

#### How to Protect Yourself from Malicious Sniffing

You can't always prevent sniffing, but you can make the captured data useless to the attacker.

1. **Use HTTPS (The Padlock):** Ensure websites you log into have `https://` and a padlock in the address bar. This **encrypts** the data between your browser and the website. A sniffer might capture the data, but it will look like gibberish without the encryption key.
2. **Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network):** A VPN encrypts *all* your internet traffic from your device to the VPN server. This is **crucial on public Wi-Fi networks** (airports, cafes), which are prime targets for sniffing.
3. **Avoid Unencrypted Protocols:** Be wary of websites that use `http://` (without the 'S'), especially for logins. Never enter sensitive information on such sites.
4. **Be cautious on Public Wi-Fi:** Assume any traffic on a public network is being watched. Do not do online banking, shopping, or check email without a VPN.

**In summary: Sniffing is the interception of network traffic. It's a powerful tool for good in the hands of network administrators but a dangerous weapon in the hands of hackers. Always use encrypted connections (HTTPS, VPN) to protect your data from it.**

### 6. Packet Sniffer

A **packet sniffer** (also known as a **network analyzer** or **protocol analyzer**) is the specific hardware or, more commonly, software tool used to perform sniffing.

If sniffing is the *act* of listening to network traffic, a packet sniffer is the *device* or *application* that makes it possible. It's the "camera on the highway" or the "tapped phone line" from our analogies.

---

### How Does a Packet Sniffer Work?

A sniffer works by exploiting a fundamental feature of how networks operate:

1. **Promiscuous Mode:** Normally, **a network interface controller (NIC)** ‚Äî your computer's network card ‚Äî only pays attention to data packets specifically addressed to it. A sniffer puts the NIC into **"promiscuous mode."** In this mode, the NIC ignores the destination address and captures **every single packet** that passes through the network segment it is connected to.
2. **Capture & Decode:** The sniffer captures these raw, binary data packets off the wire.
3. **Analysis:** The software then decodes the packets, organizing the raw data into readable formats according to the rules of network protocols (like Ethernet, TCP/IP, HTTP). It can display everything from which computers are talking to each other to the actual content of their conversation.

---

#### Common Packet Sniffer Tools

These tools are used by both **security professionals (ethical)** and **hackers (malicious)**.

| Tool Name | Primary Use | Platform |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wireshark** | The world's most popular and widely-used network protocol analyzer. It is free, open-source, and incredibly powerful for deep analysis. | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| **tcpdump** | A command-line-based packet analyzer. It is the predecessor to Wireshark and is a powerful tool available by default on most Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS). | Linux, macOS, Unix |
| **TShark** | The command-line version of Wireshark. Useful for automating capture and analysis. | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| **Kismet** | A powerful tool specifically for sniffing wireless (Wi-Fi) networks. It can detect hidden networks and capture traffic. | Linux, macOS |
| **Cain & Abel** | A older but famous tool for Windows that could sniff passwords, perform ARP poisoning, and crack encrypted passwords. | Windows |

---

#### The Two Sides of a Packet Sniffer: A Tool is Just a Tool

| For Good (Ethical) | For Bad (Malicious) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Network Diagnosis:** A sysadmin uses **Wireshark** to find why the network is slow and discovers a single computer is flooding the network with requests. | **Credential Theft:** A hacker uses **Wireshark** on a public Wi-Fi to capture unencrypted login packets for a website that uses `http://` instead of `https://`. |
| **Security Auditing:** A cybersecurity analyst uses **tcpdump** on a server to monitor for suspicious incoming connections and intrusion attempts. | **Espionage:** A malicious insider uses a sniffer to capture and read unencrypted email traffic within a corporate network. |
| **Software Development:** A developer uses **Wireshark** to debug why their new app is not communicating correctly with a server. | **Session Hijacking:** An attacker uses **Cain & Abel** to perform ARP spoofing and capture session cookies to hijack a user's logged-in account. |

#### How to Defend Against Malicious Packet Sniffing

The defense isn't to prevent the *sniffing* itself, but to render the *captured data useless*.

1. **Encryption, Encryption, Encryption:** This is the ultimate defense.
    * **HTTPS/SSL/TLS:** Ensures your web traffic is encrypted. Look for the padlock icon in your browser.
    * **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Encrypts *all* traffic from your device to the VPN server, making it unreadable to any sniffer on your local network (e.g., public Wi-Fi).
    * **SSH (Secure Shell):** Encrypts remote command-line logins and file transfers.
    * **Encrypted Messaging:** Use apps like Signal, WhatsApp (with E2E encryption enabled).

2. **Network Segmentation:** Breaking a network into smaller subnets (segments) limits how much traffic a sniffer can see. A sniffer on the "Guest Wi-Fi" segment shouldn't be able to see traffic on the "Finance Department" segment.

3. **Switched Networks:** Modern networks use **switches**, which are smarter than old hubs. They send data only to the specific device it's intended for, making passive sniffing ineffective. (However, attackers use techniques like **ARP spoofing** to bypass this).

**In summary:** A **packet sniffer** is the tool that makes **sniffing** possible. It's a powerful double-edged sword, vital for managing and securing networks, but also a potent weapon for attackers. The best defense is to ensure your sensitive data is always encrypted in transit.

---

### 7. Gaining Access

Goal of most hackers = **get inside**.

* Brute force, credential stuffing.
* Exploiting software bugs.
* Social engineering (‚ÄúHey IT support, I lost my password‚Ä¶‚Äù).
* Phishing ‚Üí fake login page.

üëâ Think of it like breaking the lock to enter a house.

---

### 8. Escalating Privileges

Once inside ‚Üí attacker wants **admin/root power**.

* **Vertical escalation** ‚Üí normal user ‚Üí admin.
* **Horizontal escalation** ‚Üí one user ‚Üí another user (same level).

üëâ Example: From student login to faculty/admin portal.

---

### 9. Executing Applications

Running malicious code inside the target.

* Drop malware ‚Üí execute it.
* Remote access tools (RATs).
* Scripts that steal data or open backdoors.

üëâ It‚Äôs like planting a spy robot inside the system.

---

### 10. Hiding Files

After planting, hacker hides the traces.

* Rootkits ‚Üí hide processes/files.
* Rename/move files.
* Store in unusual locations (e.g., system drivers).

üëâ Think: ‚ÄúInvisible cloak‚Äù for malware.

---

### 11. Covering Tracks

Final step = remove evidence.

* Clear logs.
* Delete malware after mission.
* Fake timestamps.

üëâ So investigators can‚Äôt trace them easily.

---

### 12. Virus

* **Analogy:** A biological virus. It needs a host to survive and spread.
* **Definition:** A piece of **malicious code** that attaches itself to a legitimate, executable file or program (e.g., a `.exe` file, a Word document with macros). It cannot run on its own.
* **Key Characteristic: Requires Human Action.** It relies on a user to execute the infected host file. Once executed, it replicates by inserting its code into other files on the same system.
* **Primary Purpose:** To spread to other files, corrupt data, and sometimes deliver a payload (like deleting files or displaying messages).

#### ü¶† Types of Viruses

1. **File Infector Virus**
    * **What it infects:** It attaches itself to executable files (like `.exe`, `.com`, `.scr` files).
    * **How it works:** When the infected file is run, the virus activates and can spread to other files. This can destroy the host file, corrupting programs.
    * **Example:** The classic **CIH** virus (also known as "Chernobyl").

2. **Boot Sector Virus**
    * **What it infects:** It infects the Master Boot Record (MBR) of a hard drive or the boot sector of a floppy disk.
    * **How it works:** It loads into memory every time the computer starts up, even before the operating system loads, making it very hard to remove.
    * **Example:** **Stoned** virus was a common boot sector virus.

3. **Macro Virus**
    * **What it infects:** It infects documents, not programs. It embeds malicious code in the macros of documents like Microsoft Word (`.doc`), Excel (`.xls`), or PowerPoint.
    * **How it works:** When you open the infected document and enable macros, the virus runs and can infect other documents.
    * **Example:** The **Melissa** virus spread via email attachments and infected Word documents.

4. **Multipartite Virus**
    * **What it infects:** A hybrid virus that can infect both **boot sectors** and **files**.
    * **Why it's dangerous:** It uses multiple methods to spread, making it more complex and harder to eradicate.

5. **Polymorphic Virus**
    * **Its Special Power: It changes itself.** It encrypts its code differently each time it infects a new file. This changing signature makes it very difficult for traditional antivirus software to detect.
    * **Example:** The **Storm Worm** used polymorphic code to avoid detection.

6. **Metamorphic Virus**
    * **Even more advanced than polymorphic.** It doesn't just encrypt itself differently; it completely **rewrites its own code** each time it infects a new file. It's like a criminal who gets a full plastic surgery after every crime.

---

### 12. Worm

* **Analogy:** A self-replicating parasite. It doesn't need a host; it's a standalone organism.
* **Definition:** A **standalone malicious program** that replicates itself to spread to other computers. It operates independently.
* **Key Characteristic: Self-Replicating and Spreads Automatically.** It exploits vulnerabilities in network services or operating systems (e.g., EternalBlue) or tricks users (e.g., email attachments) to spread without any human interaction after the initial execution. This makes worms incredibly dangerous for generating massive network-wide infections.
* **Primary Purpose:** To spread as widely as possible, often overwhelming networks (a "denial-of-service" effect). It can also carry a destructive payload.
* **Is a Worm a Virus?** No. This is a key distinction. **All worms are not viruses, but all viruses are not worms.** A worm is a type of malware that is defined by its **method of spreading (self-replication over networks)**. A virus is defined by its **method of infecting (requiring a host file)**.

### üêõ Types of Worms

A worm is defined by its **self-replicating nature** and its ability to spread without a host file. Their types are often categorized by their **method of propagation**.

1. **Email Worms**
    * **How they spread:** They spread by sending copies of themselves to all contacts in a victim's email address book.
    * **Trickery:** They often use compelling subject lines like "I love you," "Your invoice," or "Your video."
    * **Famous Example:** The **ILOVEYOU** worm (2000) caused billions in damage by overwriting files and spreading via email.

2. **Network Worms (or Internet Worms)**
    * **How they spread:** They exploit vulnerabilities in network services to spread across the internet or a local network. They don't need user interaction.
    * **How it works:** The worm scans the internet for computers that have a specific weakness (e.g., an unpatched Windows flaw), then copies itself to that machine.
    * **Famous Example:** **WannaCry** was a ransomware *worm*. It used the "EternalBlue" exploit to spread rapidly across networks.

3. **File-Sharing Worms (P2P Worms)**
    * **How they spread:** They copy themselves into shared folders on peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks (like BitTorrent or old-school LimeWire).
    * **Trickery:** They disguise themselves with names of popular movies, songs, or cracked software.
    * **Example:** A user downloads "Latest_Movie.mp4.exe" from a torrent site, which is actually a worm.

4. **Instant Messaging (IM) Worms**
    * **How they spread:** Similar to email worms, but they send malicious links to all contacts on messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, or Facebook Messenger.
    * **Trickery:** The message is often something urgent or curious, like "Is this you in this video?" with a link.

5. **IRC Worms**
    * **Old-school but classic:** They spread through Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels by sending infected files or scripts to other users.

---

### 12. Trojan Horse (or Trojan)

* **Analogy:** The ancient Greek story. It looks like a desirable gift but hides soldiers inside.
* **Definition:** A type of malware that **disguises itself as legitimate or desirable software** (e.g., a free game, a cracked program, a fake software update).
* **Key Characteristic: Deception and No Self-Replication.** It does not replicate itself or infect other files. Its power lies in tricking the user into installing it. Once inside, it performs a malicious action on the victim's system.
* **Primary Purpose:** To create a **backdoor**, steal data (banking info, passwords), spy on the user (keylogging), or download other malware. Its purpose is specific and targeted.

#### üé≠ Types of Trojan

1. **Backdoor Trojan**
    * **Purpose:** Creates a "backdoor" on your system, giving the attacker remote control. It's the most common type.
    * **Example:** The attacker can run commands, steal files, or use your computer as part of a botnet.

2. **Banking Trojan**
    * **Purpose:** Specifically designed to steal your online banking credentials and credit card information.
    * **How:** It often uses a **web inject** technique‚Äîit modifies the web pages you see in your browser on the fly, adding extra fields to capture your PIN or password.
    * **Example:** **Zeus** is a famous banking Trojan.

3. **DDoS Trojan (Botnet Trojan)**
    * **Purpose:** Infects your computer to turn it into a **zombie** or **bot**. The attacker then controls thousands of these bots to launch Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks against websites.
    * **Example:** The **Mirai** botnet that took down major websites.

4. **Downloader Trojan**
    * **Purpose:** Its main job is to download and install other malicious software onto your system. It's the "first wave" of an attack.
    * **Example:** You download a fake game installer (the downloader), which then secretly installs a ransomware and a keylogger.

5. **Ransom Trojan (Ransomware)**
    * **Purpose:** Locks your files or system and demands a ransom to unlock them.
    * **Example:** **WannaCry**.

6. **Info-Stealing Trojan**
    * **Purpose:** Steals any valuable information from your computer: saved browser passwords, documents, keystrokes (keylogging), screenshots, and instant messaging logs.
    * **Example:** Many spyware tools fall into this category.

**Key Point:** Most modern Trojans are **blended threats**‚Äîa single Trojan can act as a backdoor, downloader, and info-stealer all at once.

---

### 12. Backdoor

* **Analogy:** A secret entrance built into a castle that bypasses the main gate and its guards.
* **Definition:** Not malware itself, but a **method or vulnerability** that bypasses normal authentication and security mechanisms. It provides remote, unauthorized access to a system for an attacker.
* **Key Characteristic: Provides Covert Access.** It can be installed by a Trojan, a virus, a worm, or even intentionally by a developer for debugging (though this is a major security risk).
* **Primary Purpose:** To give an attacker persistent, stealthy control over a compromised system. The malware that creates the backdoor is often just the delivery mechanism; the backdoor itself is the real threat.

üëâ Backdoor = like giving yourself a spare key üîë.

### üß† Combined Malware Summary Table

| Malware Family | What it Is / How it Spreads | Key Types | Main Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Virus** | **Parasite.** Must attach to a clean file and needs a human to run it. | File Infector, Boot Sector, Macro, Multipartite | **Infect & Corrupt:** Spread to other files and damage them. |
| **Worm** | **Self-Replicator.** Spreads automatically over networks without human help. | Email, Network, P2P, IM | **Spread & Overwhelm:** Propagate as fast as possible to cause chaos. |
| **Trojan** | **Imposter.** Tricks you into installing it by pretending to be legitimate software. | Backdoor, Banking, DDoS, Downloader | **Steal & Control:** Create backdoors, steal data, or download other malware. |
| **Adware** | **Annoying Salesman.** Generates revenue by showing unwanted ads. | Legitimate (bundled), Spyware-based, Scareware | **Generate Ad Revenue:** Show ads, often by tracking your browsing. |
| **Backdoor** | **Secret Passage.** Not standalone malware, but a feature left behind by other malware. | (N/A - a feature) | **Covert Access:** Give attackers persistent, hidden access to a system. |

---

### How They Work Together: A Common Scenario

Often, these threats work in combination:

1. A user is tricked into downloading and running a **Trojan** (e.g., "free_game_installer.exe").
2. The Trojan doesn't appear to do anything obvious but secretly installs a **backdoor** on the system.
3. The attacker uses the backdoor to upload a **worm** to the computer.
4. The **worm** then spreads automatically across the corporate network, infecting dozens of other machines.
5. The worm carries a **virus** as its payload, which infects and corrupts files on every machine it reaches.

This layered approach makes modern malware highly effective and dangerous. Understanding these differences is the first step in defending against them.

### 13. Types of Cyber Attacks

1. **DoS/DDoS** ‚Üí flooding system/network.
2. **Phishing/Spear phishing** ‚Üí fake emails/websites.
3. **Man-in-the-middle** ‚Üí intercepting comms.
4. **SQL injection** ‚Üí inserting malicious queries in database.
5. **Zero-day exploit** ‚Üí exploiting unknown vulnerabilities.
6. **Password attacks** ‚Üí brute force, dictionary.
7. **Insider threats** ‚Üí employees misusing access.

---

### üîç 14. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

**What it is:**
An **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** is not just a single attack, but a **long-term, targeted campaign** where an attacker (often state-sponsored) gains unauthorized access to a network and remains undetected for a long period‚Äîmonths or even years.

Think of it as a **digital spy movie**. It's not a smash-and-grab robbery; it's a spy moving into an apartment across the street from their target, watching their every move for years.

#### Key Characteristics (The "APT" Name Explained)

* **Advanced:** Uses sophisticated, custom-made malware and techniques that bypass standard security.
* **Persistent:** The goal is to maintain long-term access, not just get in and out quickly.
* **Threat:** Carried out by a coordinated, well-funded human team (a *threat actor*), not just an automated script.

#### How it Works: The APT Lifecycle

1. **Initial Compromise:** Usually through a highly targeted spear-phishing email.
2. **Establish Foothold:** Install a backdoor to maintain access.
3. **Escalate Privileges:** Gain admin rights to move freely.
4. **Internal Reconnaissance:** Map the network and find valuable data.
5. **Lateral Movement:** Move from one system to another to reach the target.
6. **Data Exfiltration:** Slowly and stealthily steal data.
7. **Maintain Presence:** Ensure they can get back in even if discovered.

**Why it's dangerous:** Because they are so stealthy, they can steal intellectual property, government secrets, or sensitive data over a long time without anyone noticing.

**Real-World Example:** The **SolarWinds hack** (2020) is a classic APT. Hackers compromised a software update, which then gave them backdoor access to thousands of companies and government agencies that used that software.

### ‚õè 15. Cryptojacking

**What it is:**
**Cryptojacking** is the unauthorized use of someone else's computer (or smartphone, or server) to **mine cryptocurrency**. It's like someone sneaking into your house to steal electricity, but in the digital world.

Attackers don't want your data; they want your **computing power** (CPU/GPU cycles) to generate money for them.

#### How it Works

There are two main methods:

1. **Web-based (In-browser mining):**
    * A website you visit runs a JavaScript code in your browser.
    * While you're on the site, your CPU usage spikes, mining crypto for the site owner.
    * Your computer might slow down and get hot.
    * This is often done by shady websites or even ads on legitimate sites.

2. **Malware-based:**
    * You download a malicious file (e.g., a pirated software, a fake game).
    * It installs a hidden mining program (often a Monero miner, as it's hard to trace).
    * The program runs silently in the background whenever your computer is on.

**Why it's common:** It provides a direct financial reward for attackers with a lower risk than ransomware (it's quieter and often not noticed by the victim).

**How to spot it:** Your device is unusually slow, fans are running loudly for no reason, and your electricity bill might go up!

### Some fun story

You might be surprised to hear about a friend's early experiences with computers. His very first PC was technically genuine hardware, but it came with an unauthorized copy of Windows. He noticed something was wrong almost immediately‚Äîhis Chrome browser would pop up with ads every couple of minutes. It turned out to be adware.

He followed online tutorials to clean it up. The scary part was realizing how sophisticated some of these attacks were. They slowly tried to disable Windows Defender, and at one point, his computer wouldn‚Äôt even restart properly. He even found changes deep in the system‚Äîlike in the Registry, where Windows manages app and system settings‚Äîwith values being altered from 0 to 1. He kept deleting those entries like a daily routine check until he finally decided to just install a clean version of Windows 10 himself.

He's much more careful now and eventually built his current PC from scratch to avoid those kinds of issues.

The whole situation reminded him of his math teacher back in the day. The teacher used to download movies from, let‚Äôs say, less-than-trustworthy torrent sites. While some sites can be relatively safe, the teacher didn‚Äôt realize how risky some of those places were. Eventually, his laptop got hijacked, and all his files were encrypted. The hacker left a `readme.txt` asking for ‚Çπ2000 to return his data. He asked my friend for help, but at that time, neither of them knew how to deal with ransomware. It was a tough lesson in digital safety.

#### Diagnosis: What Kind of Adware Was It?

Based on the symptoms‚Äî**"PC with an unauthorized Windows copy"** and **"Chrome popping up with ads every couple of minutes"**‚Äîthis was almost certainly a case of **Spyware-Based Adware** (the malicious kind), specifically bundled as a **Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP)**.

Let's break down why:

1. **The Delivery Method: Software Bundling (The "Trojan Horse" Method)**

   * **How it got there:** The unauthorized Windows copy (the "cracked" or pirated version) didn't just contain Windows. The person who created the install ISO file **bundled** additional software with it to make money.
   * **The Deal:** You get Windows for free, but in exchange, you also silently agree to install a bunch of adware, browser toolbars, and other PUPs that generate revenue for the software cracker.
   * **This is the most common way** this type of adware spreads. It doesn't need to exploit a vulnerability; it tricks you into installing it yourself.

2. **The Specific Type: Browser Hijacker & Ad-Injector**

   * **Ad-Injection:** The adware modified browser settings (Chrome in this case) to inject additional, unwanted advertisements into every webpage he visited, and to pop up new ad windows.
   * **Browser Hijacking:** It likely also changed his default search engine and homepage to a shady, ad-filled search portal that pays the hijacker for traffic.

3. **The Technical Mechanism: How It Works**

   The adware probably installed these components on his system:

   * **Browser Extensions:** It secretly installed malicious extensions in Chrome that had the permission to "read and change all your data on the websites you visit." This is how it injected ads.
   * **Scheduled Tasks:** It created scheduled tasks in Windows to run itself again at regular intervals, ensuring it would re-appear even if he tried to remove it.
   * **Registry Modifications:** It added itself to the Windows Registry run keys, so it would launch every time the computer started.

---

#### Summary of his experience

* **Adware hijacking Chrome** (classic nuisanceware)
* **Tampering with Windows Registry**(The Registry, where 0/1 values toggle features/security controls üü¢üî¥)
* **Disabled Windows Defender** (malware LOVES to kill protections first)
* **Ransomware** on teacher‚Äôs laptop (yep, textbook ‚Äúpay me or lose your files‚Äù situation üí∏)

> **Unauthorized Software ‚ûî Software Bundle ‚ûî Malicious PUP/Adware ‚ûî Browser Hijacker & Ad-Injector**

## ‚ö° Unit 3 ‚Äî Ethical Hacking & Social Engineering

### üîπ 1. Ethical Hacking Concepts and Scopes

üëâ **What is Ethical Hacking?**

* **Hacking** = breaking into systems.
* **Ethical hacking** = doing the same thing but *legally* and *with permission* to improve security.
* Ethical hackers are also called **White Hat hackers**.

üëâ **Why is it done?**

* To **find vulnerabilities** before black hats exploit them.
* To **strengthen systems** by patching those weaknesses.

üëâ **Scope** (very important for exams ‚ö°):

* Defines what an ethical hacker *can* and *cannot* do.
* Example: You‚Äôre hired to test a bank‚Äôs website:

  * **In-scope** ‚Üí test login, SQL injection, session handling.
  * **Out-of-scope** ‚Üí DoS attacks, customer data deletion.

üëâ **Types of scope**:

* **Black-box testing** ‚Üí hacker has no info (like an outsider).
* **White-box testing** ‚Üí hacker has full info (like source code, architecture).
* **Gray-box testing** ‚Üí partial info (like credentials but not full architecture).

---

### üîπ 2. Threats and Attack Vectors

üëâ **Threat** = any potential danger that can exploit a weakness.
üëâ **Attack Vector** = the *pathway* or *method* hackers use to deliver that attack.

Think of it like this:

* **Threat** = burglar wants to rob your house.
* **Attack vector** = he uses an *unlocked window* or *fake delivery guy disguise*.

---

‚úÖ **Common Attack Vectors**

1. **Network-based**

   * Exploiting weak Wi-Fi, sniffing packets, MITM (man-in-the-middle).

2. **Web-based**

   * SQL injection, XSS (cross-site scripting), file uploads.

3. **Email/Phishing**

   * Fake login pages, malicious attachments.

4. **Removable Media**

   * Infected USB drives (classic way of spreading worms).

5. **Social Engineering**

   * Manipulating humans instead of machines (fake tech support call).

6. **Insider Threats**

   * Disgruntled employees misusing access.

7. **Physical Access**

   * Someone plugging directly into your machine/server.

---

‚ö° **Key takeaway**: Threats exist everywhere, but attack vectors are the **entry doors** hackers choose.

---

### Quiz ‚Äì Threats & Attack Vectors

Answer in short (one word/sentence is fine):

1. A hacker sends you a phishing email with a fake login page.
   üëâ What‚Äôs the **attack vector**?

2. Your system has a weak, outdated Wi-Fi password.
   üëâ What‚Äôs the **attack vector**?

3. A disgruntled employee leaks company data.
   üëâ What‚Äôs the **threat type** here?

4. Which is broader in scope: **threat** or **attack vector**?

#### üî• Answers

1. ‚úÖ **Social Engineering** ‚Üí phishing = classic SE attack vector
2. ‚úÖ **Network-based** ‚Üí weak Wi-Fi is a doorway in
3. ‚úÖ **Insider Threat** ‚Üí disgruntled employee = textbook case (disgruntled meaning angry or dissatisfied)
4. ‚úÖ **threat is the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù (danger)**, **attack vector is the ‚Äúhow‚Äù (path/doorway)**.

### 3. Information Assurance (IA)

Think of IA as the **umbrella** of everything we‚Äôve been talking about so far. It‚Äôs not just about *defending systems*, it‚Äôs about **ensuring information stays trustworthy, available, and protected at all times**.

üîë **The 5 Pillars of Information Assurance (CIA + 2)**

1. **Confidentiality** ‚Üí Only the right people can see the info.
   *Ex:* Encryption, passwords.

2. **Integrity** ‚Üí Info must be accurate, unchanged by unauthorized people.
   *Ex:* Hashing, checksums.

3. **Availability** ‚Üí Info and systems must be accessible when needed.
   *Ex:* Backups, redundancy, DDoS protection.

4. **Authentication** ‚Üí Verify the identity of users.
   *Ex:* Login, biometrics, multi-factor authentication.

5. **Non-repudiation** ‚Üí Proving that someone actually did an action, so they can‚Äôt deny it later.
   *Ex:* Digital signatures, logs.

üí° Real-world example:
When you do **online banking**, IA ensures:

* Nobody else can see your balance (Confidentiality).
* Your balance isn‚Äôt secretly altered (Integrity).
* You can access it anytime (Availability).
* Bank confirms it‚Äôs really *you* (Authentication).
* And you can‚Äôt deny making a transfer once it‚Äôs signed (Non-repudiation).

üëâ IA = **protecting information through these five pillars**.

#### üí° Mnemonic

NRACIA: Non-repudiation, Authentication, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

### 4. üìå What is Threat Modelling?

It‚Äôs the process of **thinking like an attacker** to figure out:

1. What assets you have (what‚Äôs valuable).
2. Who might attack you.
3. How they could attack you (vectors).
4. How bad it would be if they succeed.
5. How to stop them.

---

#### ‚ö° Steps in Threat Modelling

1. **Identify Assets** ‚Üí What do you want to protect?
   *Ex:* Customer data, bank details, source code.

2. **Identify Threats** ‚Üí Who/what can harm it?
   *Ex:* Hackers, disgruntled insiders, malware, natural disasters.

3. **Identify Vulnerabilities** ‚Üí Weak points in the system.
   *Ex:* Weak passwords, outdated software, open ports.

4. **Identify Attack Vectors** ‚Üí How the attack could be carried out.
   *Ex:* Phishing emails, SQL injection, stolen credentials.

5. **Assess Risks** ‚Üí What happens if they succeed?
   *Ex:* Data breach ‚Üí reputation loss + legal penalties.

6. **Mitigate Threats** ‚Üí Apply countermeasures.
   *Ex:* Patch systems, add firewalls, train employees.

üí°**Mnemonic:** AT-VART: Assets, Threats, Vulnerabilities, Attack Vectors, Risks, Threats

---

#### üîë Popular Threat Modelling Methodologies

* **STRIDE (by Microsoft)** ‚Üí Looks at threats as:

  * **S**poofing identity
  * **T**ampering with data
  * **R**epudiation (denying actions)
  * **I**nformation disclosure
  * **D**enial of Service
  * **E**levation of privilege

* **DREAD** ‚Üí Risk rating model
  
  * **D**amage
  * **R**eproducibility
  * **E**xploitability
  * **A**ffected users
  * **D**iscoverability

---

#### üí° Real-life analogy

Imagine protecting your house:

* Asset = Jewelry inside.
* Threat = Thief.
* Vulnerability = Weak lock on the door.
* Attack vector = Breaking the lock.
* Risk = Jewelry stolen.
* Mitigation = Upgrade to strong lock + CCTV.

üëâ That‚Äôs exactly what threat modelling does for computer systems.

---

### 5. EISA - Enterprise Information Security Architecture

It‚Äôs a **blueprint** (or framework) that shows how security fits into every part of an organization‚Äôs IT systems.
Think of it as **city planning for security** ‚Üí where to place roads, traffic signals, and checkpoints so everything runs smoothly and safely.

---

#### üèóÔ∏è Key Components of EISA

1. **Policies & Standards**

   * High-level rules.
   * Example: ‚ÄúAll employees must use strong passwords.‚Äù

2. **Processes & Procedures**

   * Step-by-step actions to follow.
   * Example: ‚ÄúIf someone forgets a password, IT must verify ID before reset.‚Äù

3. **Technology Controls**

   * Actual tools used for security.
   * Firewalls, IDS/IPS, antivirus, encryption.

4. **People**

   * Employees must be trained to follow security practices.
   * Example: Security awareness training.

5. **Governance & Compliance**

   * Ensuring everything follows laws and regulations.
   * Example: GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001.

**üí° Mnemonic:**
Learn this, it helps:

1. Learn PPT GPT then associate it with Chat GPT
2. GPT = Government People Tech
3. Chat GPT maintains **Policies and Standards** with following **procedures and** executing vector trees as **processes** in background

---

#### ‚ö° Layers in Security Architecture

1. **Business Layer** ‚Üí Why security is needed (protecting business goals).
2. **Information Layer** ‚Üí Data classification, storage, backups.
3. **Application Layer** ‚Üí Security in apps (auth, validation).
4. **Technology Layer** ‚Üí Networks, servers, endpoints.
5. **Physical Layer** ‚Üí CCTV, biometrics, physical access.

**üí° Mnemonic:** BlueTooth API ‚Üí BT API
Business, Technology, Application, Physical, Information

---

#### üéØ Goals of EISA

* Ensure **confidentiality, integrity, availability** (CIA triad).
* Provide **standardized security practices** across the organization.
* Reduce **risks, costs, and redundancy**.
* Make sure security supports business objectives (not block them).

---

üí° **Analogy:**
If threat modelling is like planning *how thieves might break into your house*,
EISA is like *designing the entire neighborhood* with police stations, CCTV, streetlights, and locks on every house.

üî• That‚Äôs brilliant, Dipsana!
You‚Äôre making **mnemonics like a hacker-professor yourself** üòé

* **BT API** ‚Üí perfect shortcut for remembering the layers.
* **Chat GPT** ‚Üí super creative for the key components! (Policies ‚Üí Procedures ‚Üí Tech, then Governance-People-Tech).

This way, you‚Äôre building your own **memory palace** üè∞ for cybersecurity concepts.

---

### 6. üìå What is VAPT?

It‚Äôs like a **health check-up for systems**:

* **Vulnerability Assessment (VA)** ‚Üí Finding weaknesses (like a doctor running tests).
* **Penetration Testing (PT)** ‚Üí Actually trying to exploit them (like a stress test).

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è Vulnerability Assessment (VA)

* **Goal:** Identify, classify, and prioritize vulnerabilities.
* **Methods:**
  * Automated scanning tools (Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys).
  * Manual reviews (config checks, patch levels).
* **Output:** List of vulnerabilities + risk ratings (low, medium, high, critical).

---

#### ‚öîÔ∏è Penetration Testing (PT)

* **Goal:** Simulate real-world attacks to check if vulnerabilities can be exploited.

* **Approach:**

  1. **Reconnaissance** ‚Üí Collect info (IP, domain, emails).
  2. **Scanning** ‚Üí Find open ports, services.
  3. **Gaining Access** ‚Üí Exploit vulnerability.
  4. **Maintaining Access** ‚Üí Backdoors, trojans (to test persistence).
  5. **Reporting** ‚Üí Document findings to the client.

  **Mnemonic:** Remember Student Life Simulator?
    1. **Recon** Syllabus
    2. **Scan** Subjects
    3. **Gain** Marks
    4. **Maintain access** by revision
    5. **Report** Card
    You can ignore the forget everything part (cover tracks) for this one ü§£.

* **Types:**

  * Black Box (no info given).
  * White Box (full info given).
  * Grey Box (partial info given).

---

#### üß† Difference Between VA and PT

* VA ‚Üí **Broad but shallow** (finds *all possible* weak spots).
* PT ‚Üí **Deep but narrow** (tests if weak spots can actually be hacked).

---

‚ö° **Analogy:**
VA is like **checking doors and windows** in your house to see if they‚Äôre unlocked.
PT is like **hiring a burglar** to test if they can actually break in.

---

### 7. üì® What is a Ping Packet?

**In Simple Terms:**
A **ping** is like shouting "Hello, are you there?" across a crowded room and waiting to hear a "Yes, I'm here!" in response. It's a basic command to check if another computer on the network is reachable and how long it takes to get a response.

**Technically:**

* It uses **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** packets.
* You send an **ICMP Echo Request** packet to a target IP address.
* If the target is online and willing to respond, it sends back an **ICMP Echo Reply** packet.

**Why Hackers Use It:**
In the **Reconnaissance** phase, a hacker uses ping sweeps (sending pings to a range of IP addresses) to create a "map" of which machines are alive on a network before targeting them.

**Example:**
`ping 192.168.1.1`
This command will send packets to your router and show you the response time, confirming it's online.

---

### 8. üó∫Ô∏è What is Nmap?

**In Simple Terms:**
**Nmap (Network Mapper)** is a super-powered scanner that doesn't just shout "Are you there?" but goes up to a machine, checks all its doors and windows (ports), and even figures out what's behind them (services and operating systems).

**What it does:**

* **Discovers hosts** on a network (like a ping sweep on steroids).
* **Scans ports** to find which ones are open, closed, or filtered.
* **Identifies services** running on those ports (e.g., is it a web server, SSH server, database?).
* Can even guess the **operating system** of the target computer.

**Why Hackers & Admins Love It:**

* **Hackers** use it to find weak points (open ports running vulnerable software).
* **SysAdmins** use it for security audits to find and close holes in their own network.

**Example Command:**
`nmap -sS 192.168.1.105`
This sends a "stealth" SYN scan to the target IP to see which ports are open without fully connecting, making it harder to detect.

---

### 9. üìü What are nslookup and dig?

These are tools for interrogating the **DNS (Domain Name System)**, which is the phonebook of the internet. They translate human-readable domain names (like `google.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses (like `142.251.42.206`).

#### nslookup (Name Server Lookup)

* A classic, simpler tool available on almost all operating systems.
* Good for quick, simple DNS queries.

**Example:**
`nslookup google.com`
This will ask your default DNS server for the IP address of `google.com`.

#### dig (Domain Information Groper)

* A more powerful and flexible tool, preferred by network administrators for its detailed output.
* Provides more information than `nslookup`, such as TTL (Time to Live), authoritative name servers, and record types.

**Example:**
`dig google.com`
This will give you a detailed breakdown of the DNS resolution process for `google.com`.

**Why Hackers Use Them (DNS Interrogation):**

* **Finding Subdomains:** Attackers use them to find hidden or forgotten subdomains (like `admin.example.com`, `test.example.com`), which might be less secure.
* **Mapping Network Infrastructure:** The DNS records can reveal a lot about a company's network structure, like where their mail servers are (`mail.example.com`) or their main web servers.

---

#### Recap

| Tool/Command | Purpose | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`ping`** | Check if a host is online and responsive. | Shouting "Hello?" across a room. |
| **`nmap`** | Discover hosts, scan ports, identify services and OS on a network. | A detective checking all doors and windows of a building and noting what's behind them. |
| **`nslookup`/`dig`** | Query DNS servers to translate domain names to IPs and get other DNS records. | Looking up a name in a phonebook to find their address and other contact details. |

These are the essential "digital binoculars" and "lock-picking kits" used in the first stage of hacking‚Äîgathering information. They are crucial for both attacking and defending a network.

---

### üïµÔ∏è 10. Footprinting & Reconnaissance

**What it is:**
This is the **first and most important phase** of ethical hacking or a cyber attack. It's the process of **gathering information** about a target before launching any attack. You can't attack what you don't know.

Think of it as **casing a bank before robbing it**. You'd note the security guards' routines, the number of doors, the alarm types, etc. In hacking, you're gathering digital clues.

#### Types of Reconnaissance

* **Passive Reconnaissance:** Gathering information without directly interacting with the target. This is stealthy and hard to detect.
  * **Examples:** Searching Google, looking at social media profiles (LinkedIn for employee names), checking the Wayback Machine for old versions of the website, reading news articles about the company.

* **Active Reconnaissance:** Interacting directly with the target system to learn about it. This is riskier because it can be logged and detected.
  * **Examples:**
    * **Ping Sweeps:** Sending ping packets to see which IP addresses are alive on a network.
    * **Port Scanning:** Using tools like `Nmap` to find out which ports are open on a system (e.g., port 80 for web, port 22 for SSH).
    * **DNS Interrogation:** Querying DNS servers to find out about a target's network structure (e.g., `nslookup`, `dig`).

**Why it's crucial:** The more information a hacker gathers in this phase, the more effective and targeted their attack will be. For ethical hackers, this phase helps identify the attack surface.

---

### 11. üé≠ Types of Social Engineering

Social engineering = **hacking the human mind instead of the machine.**

---

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Phishing

* Fake emails/websites that look legit.
* Example: ‚ÄúYour bank account is locked, click here to reset.‚Äù
* Subtypes: Spear phishing , Whaling , Vishing (voice), Smishing (SMS).

üîé **Subtypes of Phishing**

Phishing is like an umbrella, and these are the flavors:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Spear Phishing üéØ** (*targeted*)

* Targeted, not random.
* Attacker researches *you* specifically (your name, workplace, hobbies).
* Example: ‚ÄúHey Dipsana, here‚Äôs your GitHub PR report‚Äù ‚Üí but it‚Äôs a trap link.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Whaling üêã** (*big shots*)

* Big fish only ‚Äî CEOs, CFOs, directors.
* Attackers mimic business emails.
* Example: Fake ‚ÄúCEO request‚Äù asking finance to wire funds to an account.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Vishing üìû** (*Voice Phishing*)

* Done via phone calls.
* Example: ‚ÄúHello, this is your bank. Please confirm your OTP.‚Äù
* Popular with fake ‚Äúcustomer care‚Äù scams.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Smishing üí¨** (*SMS Phishing*)

* Text message attacks.
* Example: ‚ÄúYour package is delayed, click here to reschedule‚Äù ‚Üí malicious link.

### 12. üîí Insider Attacks

Think of insiders as *wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing* ‚Äî they‚Äôre already inside the castle, so they don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúhack in.‚Äù

#### Types of Insider Threats

1. **Malicious Insider üê∫**

   * Has intent to harm.
   * Example: Disgruntled employee stealing customer data to sell.

2. **Negligent Insider üò¨**

   * No bad intent, just careless.
   * Example: Employee clicking on phishing links, weak passwords, misplacing laptops.

3. **Compromised Insider üé≠**

   * Legit account but taken over by an outsider.
   * Example: Attacker steals credentials via phishing ‚Üí now has ‚Äúlegit employee‚Äù access.

---

#### üö® Why Insider Attacks Are Dangerous

* They bypass perimeter defenses (firewalls, IDS/IPS).
* Insiders often have privileged access to sensitive data.
* Very hard to detect ‚Äî looks like ‚Äúnormal‚Äù activity.

---

#### ‚öîÔ∏è Prevention Strategies

* **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** ‚Üí give only the access they need, nothing more.
* **Monitoring & Logging** ‚Üí track unusual access patterns.
* **Strong IAM (Identity & Access Management)** ‚Üí enforce MFA, regular password resets.
* **Employee Training** ‚Üí many attacks succeed because of negligence.
* **Exit Policies** ‚Üí revoke access immediately when someone leaves the org.

* **C** ‚Üí Compromised

---

#### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Insider Threats ‚Äî Analogy

üí° Think type of insiders as human traits  Good, Evil and Lazy:

* **Lazy üò¥ (Negligent)** ‚Üí careless, clicks shady links, weak passwords.
* **Good üòá (Compromised)** ‚Üí account stolen, attacker uses it as a mask.
* **Evil üòà (Malicious)** ‚Üí deliberate sabotage, stealing, selling data.

---

### 13. üõ° Preventing Insider Threats

Think of it like **‚ÄúThe 4D Shield‚Äù**:

1. **Deny Excess Access üîê**

   * Principle of Least Privilege (only what‚Äôs needed).
   * Role-based access control.

2. **Detect Odd Behavior üëÄ**

   * Log monitoring (sudden downloads, odd working hours).
   * AI/UEBA (User & Entity Behavior Analytics) for patterns.

3. **Defend with Policies üìú**

   * Security awareness training.
   * Regular audits, password hygiene.
   * Immediate access revocation (the official cancellation of a decree, decision, or promise) on exit.

4. **Double-Check Identity üîë**

   * MFA, strong authentication.
   * Zero-trust model (‚Äúnever trust, always verify‚Äù).

### üõ°Ô∏è 16. OWASP Top 10

**What it is:**
The **OWASP Top 10** is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the **most critical security risks to web applications**. Think of it as a "Most Wanted" list for web vulnerabilities.

It's created by the **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)**, a non-profit foundation that works to improve software security.

**Why it's a BIG deal:**
If you are working with web apps (which everyone is), you *must* know these. They are the most common ways web apps get hacked. It's updated every few years; the current list is from **2021**.

#### The OWASP Top 10 2021 List

Here are the ten categories. You don't need to be an expert on each, but you should know what they are.

1. **A01:2021-Broken Access Control**
    * **What it is:** Users can access data or functions they aren't supposed to. E.g., by changing a URL parameter from `userid=123` to `userid=124` to see another user's data.
    * **Simple Fix:** Always check permissions on every request.

2. **A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures**
    * **What it is:** This was previously called "Sensitive Data Exposure." It means failing to properly protect sensitive data (like passwords, credit card numbers) with encryption, both in transit and at rest.
    * **Simple Fix:** Use strong encryption (TLS for transit, AES for storage) and never store data you don't need.

3. **A03:2021-Injection**
    * **What it is:** Sending malicious data to an interpreter (like a database) that tricks it into executing unintended commands. **SQL Injection** is the most famous type.
    * **Simple Fix:** Use parameterized queries (don't just splice user input into a command string).

4. **A04:2021-Insecure Design**
    * **What it is:** This is new. It's about flaws in the application's architecture and design, not its code. It's building a house with a weak foundation.
    * **Simple Fix:** Incorporate threat modeling and secure design patterns from the very start.

5. **A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration**
    * **What it is:** Leaving default settings, open cloud storage, unused pages, or revealing error messages with too much information to attackers.
    * **Simple Fix:** Harden everything. Have a repeatable setup process for all environments.

6. **A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components**
    * **What it is:** Using libraries, frameworks, and other software components with known vulnerabilities (e.g., an old version of WordPress with a known bug).
    * **Simple Fix:** Regularly scan and update your dependencies.

7. **A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures**
    * **What it is:** Problems with login functions. E.g., allowing weak passwords, not having multi-factor authentication (MFA), or letting attackers brute-force their way in.
    * **Simple Fix:** Implement strong MFA and strong password policies.

8. **A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures**
    * **What it is:** trusting software updates from untrusted sources without verifying their integrity. The SolarWinds attack is a perfect example.
    * **Simple Fix:** Use digital signatures to verify the integrity of software and data.

9. **A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**
    * **What it is:** Not having good logs or not monitoring them. If you don't log attacks, you can't detect them or know what happened after a breach.
    * **Simple Fix:** Ensure all login, access control, and server-side input validation failures are logged and monitored.

10. **A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
    * **What it is:** Tricking a server into making requests to an internal or third-party system that it shouldn't be able to access. It's like using a trusted employee to sneak into a restricted area.
    * **Simple Fix:** Sanitize and validate all user input, especially URLs.

**Exam Tip:** You don't need to memorize all ten in order, but be familiar with the names, especially **Injection**, **Broken Access Control**, and **Cryptographic Failures**.

## Unit 4 ‚Äî Cyber Forensics & Auditing (Part 1: 1‚Äì4)

### 1) Introduction to Cyber Forensics

**What it is:**
The scientific process of **identifying, preserving, collecting, examining, analyzing, and presenting** digital evidence so it‚Äôs **legally admissible**.

**Remember the mnemonic?**
*Ident preserves CD collections while examine analyzes presentations*

üéØ **Goals (mnemonic: P.I.E.R.)**

* **P**reserve evidence (no alteration)
* **I**dentify relevant sources
* **E**xtract/examine artifacts
* **R**eport clearly & credibly

üéØ **Core principles (mnemonic: C.A.R.E.)**

* **C**hain of custody (who handled what, when)
* **A**uthenticity (prove evidence is genuine ‚Üí hashes)
* **R**epeatability (another expert can reproduce)
* **E**vidence integrity (use write-blockers, imaging)

**Major branches:** computer, **memory (RAM)**, **network**, **mobile**, **cloud**, **malware** forensics.

---

### 2) Computer Equipment & Associated Storage Media

#### üîπ Where evidence lives

* **Endpoints:** desktops, laptops, servers, VMs.
* **Removable:** USB, SD/microSD, external HDD/SSD, optical discs(CDs & DVDs).
* **Internal storage:** HDD/SSD/NVMe (note: **SSD TRIM** can wipe deleted data blocks).
* **Enterprise (business companies):** RAID, NAS/SAN.
* **Cloud:** Drive/OneDrive/S3, SaaS logs.
* **Mobile/IoT:** phones, wearables, cameras, routers.

**Elaborations:**

1. **RAID is a low-level technology** that operates at the **disk level**, while **NAS and SAN are high-level technologies** that operate at the **network level**. RAID can improve the performance and reliability of a single device or server, while NAS and SAN can improve the performance and reliability of multiple devices or servers.

2. **Software as a service (SaaS) is a way of delivering software over the internet.** Instead of installing and maintaining software on your computer, you access it online through a subscription with a cloud service provider.

---

#### üîπ File Systems

‚ú® **The Core Concept: The Librarian's Rulebook**

Imagine a massive library (your hard drive).

* The **books** are your files (photos, documents, etc.).
* The **file system** is the librarian's rulebook. It dictates:
  * How books are placed on shelves (how data is written to the disk).
  * How to find a specific book quickly (how data is read).
  * How to keep a list of all books and their locations (the "table of contents").
  * How much information can be written in one book's index card (file size limits).
  * How big the shelves can be (volume size limits).

Now, let's meet the different librarians and their rulebooks.

---

#### 1. NTFS (New Technology File System)

‚ú® **The Modern, Strict Librarian (Windows' Standard)**

* **Primary Use:** The default system for internal hard drives on modern Windows computers.
* **Key Features:**
  * **Large File Support:** Can handle individual files larger than 4GB (e.g., DVD ISOs, HD movies).
  * **Large Drive Support:** Can handle massive hard drives (theoretically up to 16 Exabytes).
  * **Security & Permissions:** Supports file-level encryption (EFS) and detailed user permissions (e.g., "User A can read this file, but User B cannot").
  * **Journaling:** Keeps a "journal" of changes. If the computer crashes, the librarian can check the journal to fix errors and prevent data corruption. This is very reliable.
* **Forensic Importance:** A goldmine. The journal, permission changes, and detailed metadata can provide a timeline of user activity. Its **Master File Table ($MFT)** is a central database of every file on the drive, including "deleted" entries.

#### 2. FAT32 (File Allocation Table 32)

‚ú® **The Old, Simple, Universal Librarian**

* **Primary Use:** USB flash drives, SD cards, and older versions of Windows (95, 98).
* **Key Features:**
  * **Maximum Compatibility:** Works with *everything*‚ÄîWindows, macOS, Linux, game consoles, smart TVs, car stereos. This is its biggest strength.
  * **Limitations:** **Cannot handle files larger than 4GB.** Cannot create partitions larger than 8TB. No built-in security or permissions.
* **Forensic Importance:** Often found on removable media. Its simplicity means less metadata is stored, but its widespread use makes it very common in investigations.

#### 3. exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table)

‚ú® **The Modern, Simple, Universal Librarian**

* **Primary Use:** Designed to be the modern replacement for FAT32 on **large-capacity USB drives and SD cards** (especially those 64GB and larger).
* **Key Features:**
  * **Best of Both Worlds:** Like FAT32, it maintains wide compatibility across operating systems. Like NTFS, it **removes the 4GB file size limit** and supports huge drives.
  * **Lightweight:** It doesn't have the advanced features (journaling, permissions) of NTFS, which makes it faster for simple read/write tasks on removable devices.
* **Forensic Importance:** As common as FAT32 now for external storage. It stores more metadata than FAT32 but less than NTFS.

#### 4. ext4 (Fourth Extended Filesystem)

‚ú® **The Powerful, Open-Source Librarian (Linux's Standard)**

* **Primary Use:** The default file system for most Linux distributions.
* **Key Features:**
  * **Journaling:** Like NTFS, it uses journaling for reliability.
  * **Excellent Performance:** Highly efficient for handling large numbers of small files (like system files) and avoids fragmentation better than NTFS.
  * **Flexibility:** Supports massive file and volume sizes.
* **Forensic Importance:** Crucial for investigating Linux-based systems, servers, and Android devices. Linux's "everything is a file" philosophy means a lot of system activity is logged in files on this system.

#### 5. APFS (Apple File System)

‚ú® **The Sleek, Modern, Optimized Librarian (macOS & iOS)**

* **Primary Use:** The default file system for all modern Apple products (macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS).
* **Key Features:**
  * **Optimized for SSDs:** Designed for speed and efficiency on solid-state drives (SSDs), which are used in all modern Apple devices.
  * **Space Sharing:** Multiple volumes (e.g., your main drive and Time Machine backup) can share space on the same physical drive seamlessly.
  * **Clones:** Can create file "clones" instantly, without taking up extra space. This is key to how Time Machine works.
  * **Strong Encryption:** Built-in support for full-disk and single-file encryption.
* **Forensic Importance:** A complex but critical system for any Apple-related investigation. Understanding its cloning, space-sharing, and encryption features is essential to finding and recovering evidence.

#### üëâ Why This Matters for Forensics

A forensic analyst must know these rulebooks because **each one hides evidence in different places:**

* **NTFS:** Evidence is in the **$MFT**, journal, and permission logs.
* **FAT32/exFAT:** Evidence is more limited; focus is on file slack space and unallocated clusters.
* **APFS:** Evidence could be in **file clones** or snapshots.
* **ext4:** Evidence is in the **journal** and **inode** structures.

Using the wrong tool to image a drive or not understanding its structure could corrupt data or miss critical evidence. The file system is the map, and the investigator needs to know how to read it.

---

#### üîπ Artifact Goldmines (Windows examples)

These are **clues left behind** on a computer:

* **Event Logs** ‚Üí record of system activity.
* **Registry** ‚Üí stores config & usage history.
* **Prefetch** ‚Üí tells which programs ran recently.
* **Recent Files, Recycle Bin** ‚Üí obvious evidence.
* **Browser history/cookies** ‚Üí websites visited.
* **Pagefile/hibernation** ‚Üí may contain chat fragments, passwords.
* **USB history, Jump lists** ‚Üí external devices plugged in, files opened.

---

#### üîπ Acquisition (collecting data)

* **Dead acquisition** ‚Üí power OFF, take a copy of the hard drive.
* **Live acquisition** ‚Üí while ON, grab **RAM**, volatile info, maybe encryption keys.

---

#### üîπ Integrity

Evidence must remain **untouched**:

* Use **write-blockers** (prevents modifying drive).
* Save in formats like **RAW, E01, AFF**.
* Verify with **hashes (MD5, SHA-256)** ‚Üí if the hash matches, no tampering.

---

#### üîπ Challenges

* **Full-disk encryption** (BitLocker, FileVault) ‚Üí need keys or live capture.
* **SSDs (TRIM)** ‚Üí data erased more aggressively.
* **Cloud storage** ‚Üí proprietary formats, hard to access.
* **Mobiles** ‚Üí locked/encrypted, proprietary OS.

---

### 3. Role of Forensics Investigator

A **forensic investigator** is like a digital detective. Their role is not just finding evidence, but making sure it‚Äôs **valid in court**. Key responsibilities:

1. **Identification**

   * Spot potential sources of evidence (computers, USBs, logs, cloud, etc.).

2. **Preservation**

   * Ensure no tampering. Use **write blockers, hashes**.

3. **Collection**

   * Acquire the evidence properly (imaging drives, copying logs, seizing devices).

4. **Examination**

   * Dig deep into files, recover deleted data, analyze logs.

5. **Analysis**

   * Make sense of what‚Äôs found ‚Äî linking user activity, timeline reconstruction.

6. **Presentation**

   * Prepare reports, present in **simple and clear terms** for non-technical people (judges, lawyers).

7. **Maintain Chain of Custody**

   * Every transfer of evidence must be documented (who handled it, when, where).

---

üí° **In short**:
The investigator‚Äôs job = **Find ‚Üí Preserve ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Report** while keeping it legally valid.

**Remember the GOLD mnemonic?**
"*Ident preserves CD collections while examine analyzes presentations*" ;)

---

### 4. Forensics Investigation Process

Think of this as the **step-by-step workflow** investigators follow (very structured, like a recipe).

### üîë **Phases**

1. **Identification**

   * Spot where evidence may exist (laptop, phone, email logs, cloud storage).
   * Example: noticing suspicious login records.

2. **Preservation**

   * Prevent data loss or tampering.
   * Tools: **write blockers, imaging software**, sealing devices.
   * Calculate **hash values (MD5/SHA1)** to prove integrity.

3. **Collection**

   * Acquire evidence in a legally sound way.
   * Make **bit-by-bit copies** instead of touching originals.
   * Record everything in **chain of custody forms**.

4. **Examination**

   * Extract useful data ‚Üí look for hidden, deleted, or encrypted files.
   * Use forensic tools (EnCase, FTK, Autopsy).

5. **Analysis**

   * Correlate data: timelines, IP addresses, communication patterns.
   * Build the story ‚Üí *what happened, when, how, and who did it*.

6. **Presentation**

   * Create a clear **forensic report** (non-technical language).
   * Must be **understandable to judges, jury, auditors**.

---

**Remember the GOLD mnemonic?**
"*Ident preserves CD collections while examine analyzes presentations*" ;)

---

### 5. Collecting Network-Based Evidence

Unlike pulling files from a hard drive, this is about grabbing data **while it‚Äôs flying around in the network**.

#### üîë Key Evidence Sources

* **Firewall logs** ‚Äì blocked/allowed traffic.
* **IDS/IPS alerts** ‚Äì intrusion attempts.
* **Router & switch logs** ‚Äì IP addresses, packet details.
* **Email headers** ‚Äì sender/receiver trace.
* **Web server logs** ‚Äì requests, suspicious URLs.
* **VoIP / chat transcripts** ‚Äì in cyber harassment or fraud cases.

#### ‚ö° Challenges

* Data is **volatile** (packets disappear in milliseconds).
* **Encryption (HTTPS, VPNs)** hides content.
* Need **real-time capture tools** (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump).

#### üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices

1. Use **packet sniffers** (Wireshark, tcpdump).
2. Capture in **PCAP format** (forensic standard). **PCAP = Packet CAPture** (standard format for storing captured network traffic).
3. Sync all systems with **NTP (Network Time Protocol)** ‚Üí timestamps match.
4. Record **hash values** of captured files.
5. Ensure chain of custody ‚Üí logs about who collected what, when, and how.

üìå **Mini Trick**: *‚ÄúLogs + Packets + Time = Strong Network Evidence‚Äù*

Exactly üëç ‚Äî **PCAP = Packet CAPture** (standard format for storing captured network traffic).

---

### 6. Writing Computer Forensics Reports

This is where all the hard technical work gets translated into something a **judge, manager, or non-tech stakeholder** can actually understand.

#### üîë Goals of the Report

* Be **clear** (no unnecessary jargon).
* Be **factual & objective** (no assumptions).
* Be **legally sound** (can hold up in court).

#### üìë Typical Report Structure

1. **Introduction**
   * Case ID, investigator name, date, scope of investigation.

2. **Objectives**
   * Why was the investigation conducted?
   * Example: ‚ÄúTo determine whether unauthorized access occurred.‚Äù

3. **Methodology**
   * Tools and techniques used (e.g., EnCase, Wireshark, Autopsy).
   * Mention adherence to standards (ISO, NIST).

4. **Findings**
   * Facts only. Example: *‚ÄúLog analysis revealed 5 failed login attempts from IP 192.168.1.5 at 02:10 AM.‚Äù*
   * Include screenshots, hashes, tables.

5. **Analysis**
   * Interpret findings in context.
   * Example: *‚ÄúThe repeated failed logins suggest a brute-force attack attempt.‚Äù*

6. **Conclusion**
   * Final summary of what the evidence supports.

7. **Recommendations**
   * E.g., patch systems, stronger passwords, monitoring.

8. **Appendices**
   * Raw logs, extra screenshots, hash values.

#### ‚ú® Best Practices (Mnemonic: **C-FACED**)

* **C**lear
* **F**actual
* **A**ccurate
* **C**oncise
* **E**asy-to-read
* **D**efensible in court

---

### 7. Auditing

#### üîé What is Auditing in Cybersecurity?

Auditing = A **systematic, independent examination** of systems, applications, processes, and policies to check whether they comply with security standards and work as intended.

Think of it like: *‚ÄúAn investigator for prevention, not just detection.‚Äù*

**Bada se chota ja raha haa**, scope is decreasing ‚Üí `System (parent)` ‚Üí `processes (bacche)` ‚Üí `policies(concepts ‚Üí anewale bacche)`.
You liked it don't you ü§£?!

#### üõ†Ô∏è Types of Audits

* **Internal Audit** ‚Üí Done by the organization itself (self-check).
* **External Audit** ‚Üí Performed by third parties (objective assessment).
* **Compliance Audit** ‚Üí Checks against standards/regulations (e.g., ISO 27001, PCI DSS).
* **Operational Audit** ‚Üí Checks efficiency and effectiveness of security operations.
* **Technical Audit** ‚Üí Focuses on system configurations, access logs, vulnerabilities.

üí° **Mnemonic: ROTIE**
**R** ‚Üí Rules aka Compliance
**O** ‚Üí Operational
**T** ‚Üí Technical
**I** ‚Üí Internal
**E** ‚Üí External

#### üéØ Audit Objectives

* Ensure **confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA)**.
* Check **policy compliance**.
* Detect **anomalies / misuse / insider threats**.
* Verify **effectiveness of controls**.

üí° **Mnemonic: CIA, EC PC, MIA**
**CIA** ‚Üí Confidentiality, Itegrity, Availability
**EC PC** ‚Üí Effectiveness Control, Policies Compliance
**MIA** ‚Üí Misuse, Insider Threats, Anomalies

#### üìù Audit Checklist (Mnemonic: SCARF)

* **S**tandards compliance (ISO, NIST, PCI, GDPR, etc.)
* **C**ontrols check (access, firewall, encryption, logging)
* **A**ccuracy of records (logs, backups, evidence)
* **R**isk identification (weaknesses, threats)
* **F**ollow-ups (are issues fixed after past audits?)

---

### 8. Planning an Audit Against a Set of Audit Criteria

Audit planning = the **blueprint** üìù before actually auditing.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Steps in Planning (Mnemonic: SCOPE + CROPS)

1. **S**et audit **O**bjectives ‚Üí What do we want to check? (compliance, risks, efficiency)
2. **C**hoose **C**riteria ‚Üí ISO 27001, NIST, PCI DSS, org policies, laws.
3. **O**rganize **S**cope ‚Üí Systems, apps, departments, time period.
4. **P**repare **R**esources ‚Üí Assign auditors, schedule interviews, tools.
5. **E**xecute **P**lan ‚Üí Timelines, deliverables, reporting method.

#### üéØ Why plan?

* Avoids missing critical areas.
* Ensures objectivity (no bias).
* Keeps audit efficient & cost-effective.
* Provides clear path for evidence collection.

Perfect! üëå You nailed the **definition + scope flow** idea üí° (big ‚Üí small, parent ‚Üí child). Also your "Set, Choose, Organize, Prepare, Execute" is already clean enough ‚Äî don‚Äôt stress on the micro details; just remember it‚Äôs the **audit roadmap**.

---

### 9. Information Security Management System (ISMS)

Think of ISMS as the **skeleton of an organization‚Äôs security** ü¶¥ ‚Äî policies, procedures, controls, and processes working together to keep info safe.

**Don't confuse it with EISA!**
EISA is the architecture, this is the management.

#### üîë Core Elements (Mnemonic: Plan Do Check Act)

1. **Plan** ‚Üí Define security objectives, risks, controls (ISO 27001, NIST etc.).
2. **Do** ‚Üí Implement security controls (access control, encryption, training).
3. **Check** ‚Üí Monitor & audit (logs, SIEM, incident reports).
4. **Act** ‚Üí Improve continuously (patching, policy updates, new controls).

#### üéØ Objectives of ISMS

* Ensure **CIA triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
* Manage risks systematically.
* Ensure compliance with laws, standards (GDPR, ISO 27001).
* Build trust with stakeholders.

---

## Unit 5 ‚Äî Cyber Ethics and Laws

### 1. Introduction to Cyber Laws

* Cyber Law = **legal framework** that governs how technology, internet, and digital activities are used.

* Covers:
  * **Cybercrimes** (hacking, phishing, identity theft).
  * **Data protection & privacy**.
  * **Digital transactions** (validity of e-contracts, e-signatures).
  * **Regulation of e-commerce & e-governance**.

* In India ‚Üí **IT Act, 2000** (amended in 2008) is the primary law.

---

### 2. E-Commerce and E-Governance

üîπ **E-Commerce (Electronic Commerce)**

* Buying & selling of goods/services online.
* Includes: Online banking, shopping, ticket booking, etc.
* Cyber law ensures:
  * **Legality of digital contracts** (Section 10A, IT Act).
  * **Authenticity of e-signatures & records**.
  * **Consumer protection & fraud prevention**.

üîπ **E-Governance (Electronic Governance)**

* Use of ICT (Information & Communication Tech) by govt. for public services.
* Examples: Adhaar, GST filing, DigiLocker, online bill payments.
* Cyber law ensures:
  * **Secure e-records** (Sections 4‚Äì7, IT Act).
  * **Accountability & transparency**.
  * **Digital signatures for govt. docs**.

---

### 3. Certifying Authority (CA) and Controller

üîπ **Certifying Authority (CA):**

* Licensed entity under IT Act 2000.
* Issues **Digital Certificates** for verifying identity in online transactions.
* Ensures authenticity, confidentiality & integrity of electronic records.
* Example: NIC, TCS-CA, e-Mudhra.

üîπ **Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA):**

* Government authority regulating all CAs.
* Functions:

  * Grants licenses to CAs.
  * Monitors their activities.
  * Lays down rules for digital signatures & encryption.
  * Maintains the **Root Certifying Authority of India (RCAI)**.

**Analogy ü§≠** ‚Äî CCA is the **dad**, CA are the **kids**, and RCAI is like the **grandparent root** cert from which all trust begins!

### 4. Offences under IT Act 2000 üö®

Some key offences:

* **Unauthorized access** ‚Üí hacking into systems without permission.
* **Identity theft** ‚Üí misusing someone‚Äôs digital signature, password, or credentials.
* **Cyber fraud & cheating** ‚Üí online scams, fake e-commerce.
* **Obscenity & pornography** ‚Üí publishing or transmitting obscene content online.

### 6. ‚öñÔ∏è IT Act, Section 43A (Data Breach Liability)

**What it is:**
**Section 43A of the IT Act, 2000** is a crucial rule that holds companies accountable if they are negligent with your sensitive personal data.

**In Simple Terms:**
If a company (called a **"body corporate"** in the law) is storing your sensitive data (like passwords, financial info, health records) and fails to maintain **"reasonable security practices and procedures"** to protect it, they can be sued.

**What happens if they fail?**
If a data breach occurs because of their negligence, the company must pay **compensation** (financial damages) to the person whose data was affected.

**Why it's important:**

* This was India's first major step towards recognizing the **right to data privacy**.
* It makes businesses legally responsible for protecting the data they collect.
* It's the legal basis you can use to sue a company that leaks your data.

**Example:**
If a shopping website's database gets hacked because they stored passwords in plain text (instead of encrypting them), and your credit card info is stolen, you can claim compensation under Section 43A for their negligence.

---

### 7. üìö Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in Cyberspace

* **What it means**: Protecting creations of the mind in the digital world.
* Examples:

  * **Copyrights** ‚Üí software code, music, e-books.
  * **Patents** ‚Üí unique algorithms, hardware designs.
  * **Trademarks** ‚Üí domain names, logos.
  * **Trade secrets** ‚Üí source code, business models.

In cyberspace, risks are higher: piracy, plagiarism, counterfeit software, domain squatting. That‚Äôs why **WIPO + IT Act + Indian Copyright Act** apply.

#### üí° Key words

* **Plagiarism** ‚Üí Stealing someone‚Äôs work/ideas and pretending it‚Äôs yours.
  üëâ e.g., Copy-pasting code or blog without credit.
* **Counterfeit software** ‚Üí Fake / pirated versions of paid software.
  üëâ e.g., Cracked MS Office or Photoshop.

#### üèõ WIPO

**World Intellectual Property Organization** ‚Üí UN agency that sets global rules for IPR (so creators‚Äô rights are protected across countries).

#### ü™ô Indian Copyright Act

Law in India that protects creators of music, films, books, software, etc. Works hand-in-hand with IT Act to fight piracy online.

> ‚úÖ So IPR in cyberspace = protecting **content, inventions, brand identity, and secrets** from piracy, plagiarism, fake software, or misuse online.

---

### 8. Cyber Ethics at Network Layer ‚Äî IPSec

* **IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)** = a protocol suite for secure communication over IP networks.
* Works at **Network Layer** ‚Üí secures data as it travels.

* Provides **CIA** (the big 3 you learned):
  * **Confidentiality** ‚Üí encrypts packets.
  * **Integrity** ‚Üí ensures no tampering.
  * **Authentication** ‚Üí confirms sender identity.

* Two modes:
  * **Transport Mode** ‚Üí encrypts just the message/data.
  * **Tunnel Mode** ‚Üí encrypts whole packet (used in VPNs).
* Ethics angle ‚Üí Using IPSec means you respect privacy, ensure secure transactions, prevent eavesdropping/hacking. Not using it ‚Üí unethical, risky.

üòÇ **Fun Analogies**

üåÄ Ever wondered why we always see "Entering Proton Tunnel" message infinite number of times?
That‚Äôs Proton VPN just putting our data in a secret encrypted tube so no one peeks üëÄ(not even your ex).

üòè DNS Adguard - I know what you do üòÇ
In our phones we have three modes of **DNS: off, auto and custom**. That **Auto DNS mode is our transport layer** where our **IPSec bodyguards** inform others by whispering into each other's earsüëÇüîí. I wonder how they maintain the integrity of the data. Tough job‚Ä¶ but someone‚Äôs gotta do it. ü´†

### üìò 9. Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB) / Act

**What it is:**
The **PDPB** is a proposed comprehensive law that aims to be India's version of the EU's famous **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**. It's a much more detailed and powerful extension of the idea behind Section 43A.

**Its Core Principles (The Big Ideas):**

1. **Consent:** Companies must take your clear, free consent before collecting or using your personal data. They can't hide it in long terms & conditions.
2. **Purpose Limitation:** They can only use your data for the specific purpose they told you about. They can't collect it for one reason and use it for another.
3. **Right to be Forgotten:** You have the right to ask a company to delete your personal data.
4. **Data Localization:** Critical personal data must be stored on servers within India.
5. **Data Protection Authority:** The bill proposes creating a powerful regulatory body to enforce these rules and punish violations.

**Status:** It has been passed as the **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023**. This is the law now, making it even more critical to understand.

**Why it's a BIG deal:**
It fundamentally shifts power back to the individual. It gives you control over your own data and imposes heavy penalties on companies that misuse it.

### 10. üåê How governments block websites

In India (and most countries), blocking happens at the **ISP (Internet Service Provider)** level:

1. **DNS Filtering** ‚Üí ISPs configure their DNS servers to not resolve banned domains. (So adult websites ‚Üí won‚Äôt give you an IP).
2. **IP Blocking** ‚Üí They blacklist certain IP ranges so requests never reach the server.
3. **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** ‚Üí Advanced filtering ‚Üí looks inside traffic to block based on content/keywords.

üëâ VPNs bypass this by creating an **encrypted tunnel**, so ISPs can‚Äôt see *what* you‚Äôre accessing. They only see encrypted traffic going to a VPN server.

That‚Äôs why the sites may be ‚Äúbanned,‚Äù but enforcement is imperfect, and individuals aren‚Äôt usually arrested for bypassing unless they engage in **illegal distribution** (like running servers, selling access, etc.).
